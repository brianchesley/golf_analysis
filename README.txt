I created this to analyze PGA Tour money list from 1980 to 2012. I have one file to scrape the data using Beautiful Soup, and a second file to analyze the data using Pandas.

I wrote about this further on my blog:

I also included a couple of the graphs generated by the analysis with Pandas and the CSV file I generated in the scraping section.
